# World_Weather_Analysis
## Module 6
### Purpose
The purpose was to creat a PlanMyTrip app. The Beta testers have recommended a few changes to the app. They recommend adding the weather description to the weather data we've already retrieved. This was done at their request. Then we had the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations we choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API,we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. You can see these images/final products below.
